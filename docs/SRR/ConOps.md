# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

---

## 1. **Introduction**
This document describes the Concept of Operations (ConOps) for the AI-powered drone project, showcasing its capabilities and interactions during the Intel Innovation event. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of integrating various AI technologies in a simulated autonomous drone environment.

## 2. **Purpose**
The primary purpose of this project is to provide an engaging experience for event attendees, highlighting the use of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and audio technologies. The system will simulate the brain of an autonomous drone, focusing on AI interaction rather than flight control.

## 3. **Scope**
This ConOps outlines the high-level overview of the system's intended functionality, key features, and expected interactions during the event. It does not cover the technical implementation details or long-term operational aspects.

## 4. **System Overview**
The system consists of the following components:
- **Hardware:** NUC AI PC embedded in a drone frame, equipped with cameras and audio hardware.
- **Software:** AI models for computer vision, NLP, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.
- **User Interface:** Voice interaction and mobile application for tracking and control.

## 5. **Operational Context**
The system will operate within the event venue, engaging with attendees in real-time. Key operational aspects include:
- **Setup and Initialization:** The drone will be stationed at a designated area with a visible presence. Initial setup includes powering the system and testing all functionalities.
- **User Interaction:** Attendees can interact with the drone through voice commands. The system will respond using AI models to provide information, answer questions, and simulate delivery scenarios.
- **Demonstrations:** The system will demonstrate facial recognition for secure delivery, object detection for environmental awareness, and conversational capabilities using NLP.

## 6. **Key Features**
- **Object Detection and 3D Position Mapping:** Identifying and interacting with objects and people in the environment.
- **Facial Recognition:** Secure identification of users for simulated deliveries.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human-like text for engaging interactions.
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:** Enabling hands-free and vision-free interactions.

## 7. **Expected Benefits**
- Demonstrates the potential of AI in autonomous systems.
- Engages attendees with interactive and informative experiences.
- Showcases Intel's hardware capabilities and AI advancements.

## 8. **Operational Environment**
The system will operate indoors within the event venue, with controlled lighting and noise levels. The environment will be accessible to attendees for direct interaction.

## 9. **Limitations and Assumptions**
- The drone will not perform actual flight or navigation.
- Interaction scenarios are pre-defined and focused on demonstrating AI capabilities.
- The system will rely on stable network connectivity for certain functionalities.

## 10. **Conclusion**
This project offers a glimpse into the future of autonomous aerial vehicles and services, focusing on AI-driven interactions and user engagement. The ConOps provides a high-level overview of the system's intended use and functionality during the Intel Innovation event.
