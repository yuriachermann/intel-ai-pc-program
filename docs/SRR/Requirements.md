# System Requirements

---

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI-powered drone project equipped with a NUC AI PC. The project aims to simulate the "brain" of an autonomous drone, focusing on interactions and AI capabilities.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Core Functionalities
- **Computer Vision**
    - **Object Detection and 3D Position Mapping:** The system shall detect objects and estimate their distance and position relative to the drone.
    - **Facial Recognition:** The system shall identify users for secure food delivery and access control.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    - **Question Answering:** The system shall understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
    - **Order Placement and Customization:** The system shall assist users in placing food orders, including customizing their selections.

- **Audio**
    - **Speech-to-Text:** The system shall convert spoken words into text for processing.
    - **Text-to-Speech:** The system shall convert text responses into spoken words for user interaction.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Performance
- The system shall process and respond to user interactions within 2 seconds.
- The facial recognition accuracy shall be at least 95%.

### 3.2. Usability
- The system shall support interactions in multiple languages, including English, German, and Portuguese.
- The user interface for order placement and delivery tracking shall be intuitive and accessible.

### 3.3. Security
- All data, including facial recognition and user orders, shall be securely transmitted and stored.
- The system shall comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.

### 3.4. Reliability
- The system shall have an uptime of 99% during the event.
- The system shall handle up to 50 simultaneous interactions without performance degradation.

### 3.5. Maintainability
- The system shall be modular to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
- The system documentation shall be clear and comprehensive for future developers.

## 4. Constraints
- The drone shall not perform any flight control operations.
- The project shall be fully operational and ready for demonstration by the Intel Innovation event date.

## 5. Assumptions
- Reliable internet access will be available at the event venue.
- The necessary hardware components, including the NUC AI PC and cameras, will be provided and set up correctly.

## 6. Dependencies
- The system's functionality depends on third-party AI models and frameworks for computer vision and NLP.
- Integration with the event's infrastructure, such as power and network connections.
