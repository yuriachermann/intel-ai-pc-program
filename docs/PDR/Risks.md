# Risks

---

## Overview
This document outlines potential risks associated with the development and demonstration of the AI-powered drone project. It includes risk identification, potential impacts, and proposed mitigation strategies.

## Identified Risks

### 1. **Hardware Malfunction**
- **Description:** Components such as the NUC AI PC, sensors, or power systems may fail during the demonstration.
- **Impact:** Loss of functionality, inability to complete the demo, negative impression on attendees.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Conduct thorough pre-event testing and maintenance.
    - Have backup components and equipment on standby.
    - Ensure a technical support team is available during the event.

### 2. **Software Bugs or Glitches**
- **Description:** Bugs in AI models, integration code, or user interface software may lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior.
- **Impact:** System crashes, incorrect responses, or inability to demonstrate key features.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Implement rigorous testing and debugging processes.
    - Develop a contingency plan with fallback options or simplified demos.
    - Prepare a script or guide for manual intervention if needed.

### 2. **Environment Challenges**
- **Description:** Noisy or crowded environments may interfere with speech recognition or sensor readings.
- **Impact:** Reduced accuracy of AI models, misinterpretation of commands, or system errors.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Conduct environmental assessments and adapt system parameters accordingly.
    - Use noise-canceling or directional microphones for speech recognition.
    - Implement robust error handling and feedback mechanisms.

### 3. **Network Connectivity Issues**
- **Description:** Dependence on network connectivity for certain features (e.g., cloud-based services) may be disrupted.
- **Impact:** Inability to access external data or services, reduced system functionality.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Optimize for offline functionality where possible.
    - Use local data storage for critical operations.
    - Have a backup network solution, such as a dedicated hotspot.

### 4. **Power Supply Interruptions**
- **Description:** Power supply issues, such as battery failure or power surges, could interrupt the demonstration.
- **Impact:** System shutdown, data loss, damage to components.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Use reliable power sources and redundant power supplies.
    - Monitor battery levels and have extra batteries available.
    - Utilize surge protectors and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).

### 5. **User Interaction Challenges**
- **Description:** Unexpected user behavior or misuse may lead to system confusion or failure.
- **Impact:** Inaccurate system responses, potential damage, or misinterpretation of the demonstration's capabilities.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Design a robust and user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
    - Provide guided interactions and have support staff available to assist users.
    - Implement safeguards to prevent misuse or accidental damage.

## Risk Management Plan
- **Regular Risk Assessment:** Continuously assess and update risks as the project progresses.
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of risk analysis and mitigation steps.
- **Team Preparedness:** Ensure all team members are aware of potential risks and prepared to address them.

## Conclusion
This risk management plan aims to identify and mitigate potential issues that could impact the successful demonstration of the AI-powered drone project. By proactively addressing these risks, we can enhance the reliability and effectiveness of the project during the event.
