# Architecture Document

---

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the AI-powered drone project, which simulates the "brain" of an autonomous drone using a NUC AI PC. The focus is on demonstrating AI capabilities in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and audio processing.

## 2. System Components
### 2.1. Hardware
- **NUC AI PC**: Central processing unit for running AI models and managing system operations.
- **Drone Frame**: Physical structure to house the NUC and other components. It does not include flight control hardware.
- **Cameras**: Used for computer vision tasks, including object detection and facial recognition.
- **Microphone and Speaker**: For audio input (speech-to-text) and output (text-to-speech).

### 2.2. Software
- **Operating System**: Runs on the NUC AI PC, managing hardware resources and software applications.
- **Computer Vision Module**:
    - Object Detection: Identifies and classifies objects in the environment.
    - Depth Estimation: Determines the distance of objects from the drone.
    - Facial Recognition: Authenticates users for secure interactions.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module**:
    - Question Answering: Responds to user queries in real-time.
    - Order Placement and Customization: Facilitates user interactions for food selection and customization.

- **Audio Processing Module**:
    - Speech-to-Text: Converts spoken language into text for processing.
    - Text-to-Speech: Synthesizes speech from text for vocal responses.

## 3. Data Flow
1. **Input Capture**:
    - Visual data captured by cameras.
    - Audio data captured by the microphone.

2. **Processing**:
    - Visual data processed by the Computer Vision Module for object detection and recognition.
    - Audio data processed by the Speech-to-Text component, then NLP for understanding and generating responses.

3. **Output**:
    - Visual feedback displayed on a screen or through augmented reality (optional).
    - Audio responses generated by the Text-to-Speech component and output via the speaker.

## 4. Communication Interfaces
- **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system through voice commands and receive responses through speech.
- **Data Transmission**: Internal data communication between hardware components and software modules, ensuring seamless operation.

## 5. Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Facial recognition data is securely processed and stored temporarily for the duration of the event.
- **System Integrity**: Ensuring the NUC AI PC and connected components are protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

## 6. Scalability and Future Enhancements
- The architecture allows for easy integration of additional sensors and AI modules, enabling future expansion to include flight control or more advanced interaction capabilities.

## 7. Conclusion
This architecture provides a comprehensive overview of the system components and their interactions, focusing on delivering an engaging user experience through advanced AI technologies.
